Hi there! I’m Claudie Coulombe (pronounced “klo-dee koo-lomb”). I love using people analytics to help organizations find data-informed ways to create better workplaces. Outside of work, you'll find me hanging out with my two dogs, crocheting away, or volunteering at my local animal shelter. Feel free to check out my work and connect!
